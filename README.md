## 👑 **archy — Because My Fingers Are Too Delicate For A Second Manual Install**

Welcome to **archy**, my extremely *professional*, *perfectly engineered*, and *absolutely secure* Arch Linux setup script. I spared no expense... in time-saving shortcuts.

Just kidding. It's about as secure as leaving your password on a sticky note.
This entire repository exists solely because I firmly believe that manually configuring a system more than once constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

## ⚠️ Warning: Do Not Use This (Seriously, Don't) 🗑️

This script is highly customized to my **specific, bizarre, and terrible** preferences.

Unless you are **me**, you probably shouldn't run this.
Actually, even if you *are me* from two years ago, you shouldn't run this.

### What Horrors Does It Commit?

  * Copies my dotfiles (a digital shrine to chaos).
  * Replaces your pristine system configs with my spaghetti code.
  * Installs a **ton** of packages, ensuring you hit every known dependency cycle.
  * Enables autologin because typing is too much effort.
  * Grants *every* user the power of `sudo` with **no password required**. Yes, you read that right. Feel the freedom\!
  * And then, like a guilty criminal trying to erase evidence, it deletes itself out of existence.

So if you run this and your PC begins mining Bitcoin for a Russian oligarch, that's entirely on you. You were warned by the digital ghost of my future self.

## ✔️ Requirements: The High Cost of Convenience 💸

If you *insist* on using this anyway (you magnificent fool), you must meet these highly unreasonable demands:

  * Be comfortable with your system security being an elaborate joke.
  * Know what Arch Linux is (so you can *suffer* properly).
  * Have the username `iceol8ed`, or the script will violently terminate and mock you.
  * Accept that your life choices have led you to this moment.

-----

## 🤷 Why Does This Exist? (The Sins of Laziness)

  * Because setting up Arch again is a violation of the Geneva Convention.
  * Because automation means less work for me.
  * Because laziness is a deeply held philosophical virtue.
  * Mostly because I'm lazy.
  * Because I can.

## 🚀 How to Use (In Case of a Personal Security Death Wish)

Ready to ruin your weekend? Great.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iceol8ed/archy
cd archy
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

> **A Quick Note on Features:** While running, the script **might** ask for your `sudo` password, or it **might not**. I haven't really checked, and frankly, I don't care enough to fix it. Consider it a **feature**, not a bug. It keeps you on your toes.

If something breaks:
Congrats, you've achieved maximum learning. Now you know why this was a terrible idea.
