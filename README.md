## 💣 **archy**

**An automated environment bootstrapper for the impatient.**

Welcome to **archy**. It turns a vanilla Arch install into a chaotic but functional productivity powerhouse. It was written to prevent the onset of repetitive strain injury caused by typing `pacman -S` repeatedly.

### ⚙️ The "Features"

  * **Aggressive Dotfile Deployment:** Overwrites existing configs with my preferred spaghetti code.
  * **The "Trust Me Bro" Security Model:** Enables passwordless `sudo`. Great for speed, terrible for shared computers.
  * **User Check:** Strictly enforces the username `iceol8ed`. If you aren't me, you're going to have a bad time.
  * **Auto-Cleanup:** Removes itself after execution to keep your home folder pristine.

### 🤷 Why?

Because Laziness as a Virtue
Because 

### 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iceol8ed/archy
cd archy
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
