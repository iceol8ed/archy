archy — Because I’m Too Lazy To Set Up Arch Twice

Welcome to archy, my extremely professional, perfectly engineered, and absolutely secure Arch Linux setup script.

Just kidding.
It’s not secure. At all.
This entire repo exists solely because I refuse to manually configure a system more than once in my life.

⚠️ Warning: Do Not Use This

Unless you are me, you probably shouldn’t run this.
Actually, even if you are me, you probably shouldn’t run this.

This script:

Copies my dotfiles

Replaces system configs

Installs a ton of packages

Enables autologin

Lets every user run sudo with no password (yes, really)

And then deletes itself out of existence like a guilty criminal

So if you run this and your PC self-destructs, that’s on you.

✔️ Requirements

If you insist on using this anyway (you fool), you must:

Be okay with your system being wide open

Know what Arch Linux is

Understand that your security is now a myth

Have the username iceol8ed, or the script will not work and you will suffer

Accept that strange things may happen

🤷 Why Does This Exist?

Because setting up Arch again is annoying.
Because automation is life.
Because laziness is a virtue.
Mostly because I’m lazy.
Because I can.

🚀 How to Use (Don’t)

Clone it, enter the folder, then:

sudo ./archy.sh


If something breaks:
Congrats, you’ve learned why this was a terrible idea.
